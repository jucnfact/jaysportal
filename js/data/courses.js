<h2>HABITAT</h2><p>A habitat refers to the specific natural environment or place where an living thing lives, finds shelter, and interacts with its surroundings. Habitats can vary widely in terms of their physical and biological characteristics, and they play a crucial role in the survival and adaptation of species.</p><h3>Types of Habitat</h3><p>Habitats are broadly categorised into two main types: terrestrial and aquatic habitats.</p><ol><li><p><u>Terrestrial Habitats</u>: Terrestrial habitats are those found on land. They encompass various environments that support life away from water bodies. These habitats can be further divided into subtypes, including: </p><ol><li><u>Forests</u>: These are areas densely populated with trees, such as deciduous forests (which shed leaves seasonally) and evergreen forests (which have leaves throughout the year). <p><u>Animals</u>: Fox, Rabbit, Squirrel, Deer, Badger</p><p><u>Plants</u>: Oak, Pine, Bluebell, Fern, Ivy</p></li><li><u>Grasslands</u>: These are pen landscapes dominated by grasses and herbaceous plants, including meadows and savannahs. <p><u>Animals</u>: Lion, Zebra, Giraffe, Cheetah, Elephant</p><p><u>Plants</u>: Grass, Dandelion, Sunflower, Buttercup, Clover</p></li><li><u>Deserts</u>: Dry and arid regions with minimal precipitation, often characterized by extreme temperature variations.<p><u>Animals</u>: Camel, Scorpion, Lizard</p><p><u>Plants</u>: Joshua tree, Cactus</p></li><li><u>Mountains</u>: High-altitude regions with specific ecosystems adapted to cold and oxygen-thin conditions.<p><u>Animals</u>: Golden Eagle, Snow Leopard, Mountain Goat, Red Fox, Red Deer</p><p><u>Plants</u>: Scots Pine, Alpine Aster, Mountain Thyme, Mountain pine, Edelweiss, Alpine forget-me-not</p></li><li><u>Urban Areas</u>: Human-made environments like cities and towns that have their own unique flora and fauna.</li></ol><p><u>Features of Terrestial Habitat</u>:</p><ol><li>High light intensity.</li><li>Bouyancy (ability to float) is lesser compared to water.</li><li>Soil contain all necessary nutrients for production of energy.</li><li>Atmospheric air is the source of oxygen.</li><li>Water is limited and dryness prevails in deserts.</li><li>High change in temprature (temperature fluctuation).</li><li>Land is discontinuous with rivers, valleys, seas, etc.</li></ol><p><u>Adaptation of Plants and Animals in Terrestial Habitat</u>:</p><ol><li>Plant ike mango trees possess roots for acquiring water from the soil.</li><li>Plants like cactus have cuticles for preserving water and preventing water loss through transpiration.</li><li>Plants like maize plants develop stems to be able to support and maintain their leaves up and errect.</li><li>Desert animals like carmels have thick skin to prevent water loss.</li><li>Animals like goats have legs and snakes have muscular body for movement.</li><li>Carnivorous animals like lions have more developed canine teeth in mouth to tear prey.</li><li>The long tail found in monkeys help in climbing and maintaining balance while moving on trees.</li><li>Animals like horses and deers have well developed incisors to chew food.</li><li>Aerial animals like birds have light weight body and wings for flying.</li><li>Animals possess longs for breathing.</li><li>Plants possess leaves for photosynthesis.</li></ol></li><li><p><u>Aquatic Habitats</u>: Aquatic habitats are found in water bodies and can be further divided into three primary categories: <ol><li><u>Freshwater Habitats</u>: These include places like rivers, lakes, ponds, and streams where the water has a low salt concentration. Freshwater habitats support a wide range of organisms, including fish, amphibians, and aquatic plants.</p><p><u>Animals</u>: Fish, Frog, Turtle, Duck, Snail</p><p><u>Plants</u>: Water Lily, Algae, Reed, Waterweed, Cattail</p><p><u>Features of Freshwater Habitats</u>:</p><ol><li>Low density.</li><li>It has low (salt content).</li><li>The water is shallow.</li><li>The temperature varies with depth and season.</li><li>There is available oxygen in all parts of the water, but more at the surface.</li></ol></li><li><p><u>Marine Habitat</u>: These encompass the vast oceans and seas with a high salt concentration.

      <h3>Dominant and Recessive Traits</h3><p>You noticed that in Gregor Mendel's experiment reported above, he observed  that the traits (characteristics) of tallness overshadowed that of shortness, when the parental tall plants were crossed with parental short plants.</p><p>When one characteristic overshadows (shows more than) another in the offspring, it is said to be <u>dominant</u> over the other characteristics, while the one which is suppressed (not noticed) is said to be <u>recessive</u>.</p><img src="img/data/pea.webp"><div>Diagram of a garden pea</div><h4>Dominant and Recessive Traits in the Garden Pea</h4><p>The table below shows dominant and recessive traits in the garden pea as observed by Mendel.</p><img src="img/data/Dominant and Recessive Traits.png"><p>Gregor mendel wisely used pea plants for his experiments and made his observations within a short period. His results were so good and convincing that today he is regarded as the father of the science of genetics. Today, scientists use plants, rats, rabbits, chickens,  and so on for genetic experiments.</p><p>To do genetic experiments with human beings is very difficult for serveral reasons.</p><ol><li>Experimental crossing of human beings is unethical.</li><li><u>The life of a human being is long:</u> If for example, you want to know what the hair colour of children would be when a black haired man marries a light haired woman, you would have to wait for twenty or more years after marriage to get one set of results. You need to repaet this experiment several times to be confident of your result. You might not live to get confirmatory results.</li><li>If the pea plant had seven pairs of contrasting characteristics, a human would have many more than that number.</li><li>In human beings, many characteristics do not have a simple pattern, such as tall or short characteristics in peas. Many human characteristics show continuous variations from one form to another. For instance,<ol><li>Intelligence varies continuously from half-wit to genius;</li><li>Skin colour varies continuously from black to light colour;</li><li>Height varies continuously from dwarf to gaint.</li></ol></li></ol><p>Nevertheless, inheritance of traits in human beings is studied mainly through observation.</p><p>In spite of drawbacks (limitations or disadvantages), it is now possible, with a resonable measure of confidence, to identify some dominant and some recessive traits in human beings.</p><h3>Importance of Family Traits</h3><p>Knowledge of family traits has been useful in</p><ol><li>Tracing family members</li><li>Reducing the occurence of hereditary diseases like Sickle-cell Anaemia.</li><li>Crime detection</li></ol>
      
      <h2>ENVIRONMENTAL HAZARDS</h2><p>Environmental hazards are things or activities in our environment that can be harmful to the Earth and everything living on it, including human beings. These hazards can come from nature or be caused by people. They are  threats to the environment.</p><p>So, when we talk about environmental hazards, we mean things that can hurt the planet and its inhabitants. It's important to learn about them so we can protect our environment and make it a safer and healthier place for everyone.</p><h3>Types of Environmental Hazards</h3><ol><li><u>Natural Environmental Hazards:</u> Natural environmental hazards are things like earthquakes, hurricanes, and wildfires. They can be dangerous because they can harm people and wildlife, and they can damage the places we live.</li><li><u>Man-made or Artificial Environmental Hazards:</u> Man-made environmental hazards are caused by people. For example, pollution from factories and cars can harm the air we breathe and the water we drink. Trash and litter can also hurt the environment.</li></ol><h3>Examples of Environmental Hazards</h3><ol><li>Soil erosion</li><li>Flooding</li><li>Bush burning</li><li>Deforestation</li><li>Desertification (desert encroachment)</li><li>Depletion of the Ozone layer</li></ol>

<h2>Soil Erosion</h2><p>Soil erosion is the carring away of the top layer of soil on the earth surface by water, wind, or other natural forces.</p><p>Soil erosion is like nature's way of playing hide-and-seek with soil. It's when the top layer of soil, which is really important for plants and crops, gets carried away by things like wind and water. Imagine it's like a game where the soil is the player, and wind and water are the opponents trying to move it away. If we're not careful, too much soil can erode, making it hard for plants to grow and causing problems for the environment. So, soil erosion is something scientists and farmers study to make sure we keep our soil safe and sound for plants to grow in.</p><h3>Causes of Soil Erosion</h3><ol><li><u>Bush Burning</u>: When people intentionally set fire to bushes and grasslands, it can remove the protective vegetation cover that holds soil in place. Without plants, the soil becomes more vulnerable to erosion by wind and water.</li><li><u>Farming</u>: Farming, especially on slopes or without proper soil conservation practices, can lead to soil erosion. Plowing and tilling the land can loosen the soil, making it easier for wind and rain to wash it away.</li><li><u>Growth of Towns</u>: As towns and cities expand, they often replace natural vegetation with buildings and roads. This urbanization can increase the amount of paved surfaces and reduce the natural protection against soil erosion.</li><li><u>Road Constructions</u>: Building roads often involves clearing land and creating slopes. Rainwater can flow quickly over these surfaces, carrying away soil with it, especially if proper drainage systems are not in place.</li><li><u>Industrialization</u>: Industrial activities sometimes release pollutants into the air and water, which can harm plants and contribute to soil erosion. Additionally, industrial development may involve large-scale land clearance, which can lead to soil loss.</li><li><u>Building of Markets</u>: When markets are constructed without considering soil conservation, the removal of vegetation and improper drainage can contribute to soil erosion, particularly in urban areas.</li></ol><h3>Prevention and Control of Soil Erosion</h3><ol><li><u>Planting Trees or Grass</u>: Planting trees or grass helps to stabilize the soil with their root systems, reducing erosion by holding the soil in place.</li><li><u>Making Ridges Across Slope</u>: Creating ridges across the slope slows down water runoff, allowing it to infiltrate the soil, preventing erosion.</li><li><u>Terracing</u>: Constructing terraces on slopes forms level platforms to capture and control water flow, reducing soil erosion.</li><li><u>Strip Cropping</u>: Planting different crops in alternating strips helps break up the flow of water, decreasing erosion.</li><li><u>Mulching:</u> Applying a layer of organic material on the soil surface, such as straw or leaves, acts as a protective cover to prevent soil erosion by wind or water.</li><li><u>Cover Cropping:</u> Planting cover crops like legumes or grasses during non-growing seasons shields the soil, improving its stability and reducing erosion.</li><li><u>Crossbars:</u> Installing crossbars or check dams across water channels disrupts water flow and minimizes erosion by trapping sediment and reducing its downstream movement.</li></ol>

<h2>Flooding</h2><p>Flooding is the overflow of land with water, often caused by heavy rainfall, melting snow, or the overflow of rivers, lakes, or oceans.</p><h3>Drainage</h3><p>Drainage is the process of removing excess water from an area, typically to prevent flooding. It involves natural or human-made systems that direct water away to keep land dry.</p><h4>Drainage Patterns</h4><p>Drainage Patterns refer to the way water flows across the Earth's surface.</p><h4>Types of Drainage Patterns</h4><p>There are two main types:</p><ol><li><u>Urban Drainage</u>: In cities and towns, water is typically guided through a network of pipes and drains to prevent flooding. It's a controlled system designed by humans to manage rainwater and sewage efficiently.</li><li><u>Rural Drainage</u>: In rural areas, water follows natural paths like rivers and streams. The landscape determines how water flows, and there's less human-made infrastructure involved in directing it.</li></ol><h3>Causes of Flood</h3><ol><li><u>Rainwater</u>: When it rains heavily, a lot of water falls from the sky and can quickly collect on the ground. If there's too much rain in a short period, the ground can't absorb it all, leading to flooding.</li><li><u>Sea Water</u>: Sometimes, especially during storms like hurricanes, strong winds and low pressure can push seawater onto the land. This is called a storm surge, and it can cause coastal areas to flood.</li><li><u>Snow Melting</u>: In colder regions, when the temperature rises, snow and ice can melt rapidly. This melted snow adds a lot of water to rivers and streams, potentially causing them to overflow and flood nearby areas.</li><li><u>River Flooding</u>: Rivers can flood when there's too much water flowing into them from rain, melted snow, or other sources. If the river can't carry all this water, it spills over its banks and floods the surrounding land.</li></ol><h3>Preventions and Control of Flooding</h3><ol><li><u>Dams</u>: Dams are like big walls built across rivers. They stop the river's flow and store water in a reservoir. This prevents too much water from rushing downstream during heavy rains, reducing the risk of flooding in areas below the dam.</li><li><u>Embankments</u>: River or sea embankments are like raised barriers made of soil or concrete along the banks of rivers or coastlines. They act as shields to keep water within its normal course, preventing it from spilling over and causing floods in nearby areas.</li><li><u>Clearing Gutters</u>: Gutters are like channels or small drains that help rainwater flow away. When we clear gutters, we remove leaves, debris, and trash to ensure water can move easily. This prevents water from getting stuck and causing flooding in streets and neighborhoods.</li></ol><h3>Harmful Effects (Disadvantages) of Flooding</h3><ol><li>Destruction of Property</li><li>Loss of Life</li><li>Contamination of Water Sources</li><li>Crop and Food Damage</li><li>Erosion and Soil Damage</li></ol><h3>Benefits (Advantages) of Flooding</h3><ol><li><u>Sediment Deposition</u>: Flooding can deposit nutrient-rich sediments, which can enrich soil and support plant growth, aiding ecological research.</li><li><u>Ecosystem Enrichment</u>: Flooding can enrich soil with nutrients and promote the growth of aquatic life, contributing to a healthier ecosystem.</li><li><u>Nutrient Cycling</u>: When floods happen, they bring in fresh nutrients to the land. These nutrients help plants grow, which then feed animals and support the whole ecosystem. </li></ol>

<h3>Bush Burning</h3><p>Bush burning is the setting of fires in natural areas covered with plants and bushes, leading to loss of vegetation.</p><h4>Causes of Bush Burning</h4><ol><li><u>Dry Season</u>: During the dry season, there is less rain, making the vegetation drier and more prone to catching fire.</li><li><u>Human Activities</u>: People may intentionally or accidentally start fires through activities like farming, clearing land, or burning trash.</li><li><u>Lightning Strikes</u>: Lightning during thunderstorms can ignite fires when it strikes dry vegetation.</li><li><u>Negligence</u>: Careless actions like discarding lit cigarettes or leaving campfires unattended can lead to bush fires.</li><li><u>Climate Change</u>: Changing weather patterns and rising temperatures can increase the likelihood of wildfires in certain areas.</li></ol><h4>Effects of Bush Burning</h4><ol><li>Bush fires can cause air pollution.</li><li>It can destroy plant and animal habitats.</li><li>Soil erosion</li><li>It can destroy plant and animal habitats.</li><li>Climate change as a result of It release of harmful smoke and gases into the atmosphere.</li></ol><h4>Control and Prevention of Bush Burning</h4><ol><li>Don't start fires in the bushes.</li><li>Keep flammable materials away from the bushes.</li><li>Use water to put out bush fires.</li><li>Follow fire safety rules.</li><li>Report fires to authorities.</li></ol><h4>Agencies and Regulations Against Bush Burning in Nigeria</h4><ol><li><u>Federal Ministry of Environment</u>: This agency is like the boss of all environmental matters in Nigeria. It makes rules and regulations to protect the environment, including laws against bush burning.</li><li><u>National Environmental Standards and Regulations Enforcement Agency (NESREA)</u>: Think of NESREA as the "environmental police." They make sure people follow the environmental rules, including laws against bush burning.</li><li><u>Nigerian Meteorological Agency (NIMET)</u>: NIMET watches the weather. They help predict when conditions are risky for bush fires, and their warnings can be used to prevent bush burning.</li><li><u>State Environmental Protection Agencies (SEPA)</u>: Each state in Nigeria has its own agency to handle environmental issues. They often enforce bush burning rules at the local level.</li><li><u>National Parks Service</u>: They take care of national parks and reserves in Nigeria. Part of their job is to prevent and control bush fires in these protected areas.</li><li><u>Local Governments:</u> Local Governments make by-laws to control bush burning.</li><li><u>Federal Environmental Protection Agency (FEPA)</u>: FEPA enforces bush burning rules at the national level.</li></ol>

<h3>Deforestation</h3><p>Deforestation is the cutting down and removal of trees in forests, leading to the loss of forests.</p><ol><li>Deforestation reduces the number of trees, which clean the air by absorbing carbon dioxide.</li><li>It can lead to soil erosion and decreased agricultural productivity.</li><li>Loss of forest habitats endangers many plant and animal species.</li><li>Deforestation can disrupt the water cycle, leading to issues like droughts and flooding.</li><li>It contributes to climate change by releasing stored carbon back into the atmosphere.</li></ol><h4>Control and Prevention of Deforestation</h4><ol><li>Plant more trees to replace those cut down.</li><li>Use recycled paper to reduce tree cutting.</li><li>Enforce laws against illegal cutting down of trees.</li><li>Promote sustainable forestry practices.</li><li>Educate people about the importance of forests.</li></ol><h4>Nigeria Regulations on Deforestation</h4><p>Nigeria has rules to prevent cutting down too many trees. The government agencies responsible for these rules include the Federal Ministry of Environment and the National Environmental Standards and Regulations Enforcement Agency (NESREA). They work to protect the environment by making sure people don't harm the forests too much.</p>

<h3>Desertification</h3><p>Desertification is when fertile land turns into a desert as a result of drought or deforestation. It is also known as <u>desert encroahment</u>.</p><h4>Geographical Areas in Nigeria Prone to Desertification</h4><p>Some parts of Nigeria, like the northern states of Nigeria such as Sokoto, Kano, Katsina, Jigawa and Borno, are prone to desertification. This is because these areas receive very little rainfall, making it hard for vegetation to grow and protect the soil from erosion. When the soil is exposed, it becomes vulnerable to wind and water erosion, which can lead to desertification.</p><h4>Causes of Desertification</h4><ol><li><u>Natural causes of desertification</u>: <ol><li>Prolonged droughts reduce water availability.</li><li>Soil erosion by wind and water removes topsoil.</li><li>Changes in climate patterns impact vegetation.</li><li>Overgrazing by animals depletes plant cover.</li><li>Natural disasters like wildfires damage ecosystems.</li></ol></li><li><u>Artificial causes of desertification</u>: <ol><li>Deforestation for agriculture and fuel.</li><li>Poor land management practices.</li><li>Urban expansion disrupts natural habitats.</li><li>Over-extraction of water resources.</li><li>Industrial pollution harms the environment.</li></ol></li></ol><img src="img/data/overgrazing.webp"><div>Cattle Grazing. Overgrazing leaves the land bare, which can lead to desertification</div><h4>Prevention and Control of Desertification</h4><ol><li>Planting of more trees and grass.</li><li>Implementing soil conservation methods like terracing.</li><li>Reduce overgrazing.</li><li>Promote farming and water management.</li><li>Raise awareness about desertification and its effects.</li></ol>

<h3>Depletion of The Ozone Layer and Its Effects</h3><p>The atmosphere is important to nature because it provides the air we breathe, regulates Earth's temperature, and protects us from the Sun's harmful rays. It plays a vital role in supporting life and maintaining a stable environment for all living organisms on our planet.</p><img src="img/data/atmosphere.webp"><div>Layers of the atmosphere</div><h4>Location of the Ozone Layer</h4><p>The Earth's atmosphere has different layers. The first one, called the <u>troposphere</u>, is closest to the ground and goes up to about 12 km. Above that, there's the <u>stratosphere</u>, extending up to about 50 km. Next is the <u>mesosphere</u>, reaching up to approximately 85 km. Lastly, there's the <u>thermosphere</u>, which stretches out to hundreds of miles (over 100 km).The <u>exposhere</u> is also known as outer space and has very close to no gravity. It is the outter layer of the atmosphere. Each layer has its own characteristics and purposes. From 60 km to about 240 km above the ground surface is the part of the atmosphere called the <u>ionosphere</u>. It is located in the <u>mesosphere and higher layers</u>.</p><p>The ozone layer is located in the lower stratosphere, between 10 km and 80 km above the ground surface with its highest concentration at abou 25 km above the ground. Ozone is related to oxygen. However, while one molecule of oxygen contains two atoms of oxygen and has the formula O<sub>2</sub>, one molecule of Ozone contains three atoms of oxygen, and has the formula O<sub>3</sub>.</p><h4>Importance of The Ozone Layer</h4><ol><li><u>Keeps us warm</u>: It traps heat from the sun, acting like a cozy blanket for Earth.</li><li><u>Gives us light</u>: It lets in the sunlight, so we can see during the day.</li><li><u>Protects our skin</u>: It shields us from harmful ultraviolet rays that can hurt our skin and eyes.</li></ol><p>The ozone layer is like Earth's natural sunscreen. It shields us from the harmful UV rays that come from the sun. Without the ozone layer, these rays could hurt us and the environment, causing problems like sunburns, skin cancer, and harm to plants and animals. So, the ozone layer is really important for our safety and the well-being of our planet.</p><h4>Depletion of The Ozone Layer</h4><p>The depletion of the ozone layer is a process where the protective layer of ozone in the Earth's atmosphere gets thinner, allowing more harmful <u>ultraviolet</u> (UV) radiation from the sun to reach the Earth's surface. This is a problem because excessive UV radiation can harm living things, including humans.</p><p>The main cause of ozone layer depletion is the use of human-made chemicals called <u>chlorofluorocarbons</u> (CFCs). These chemicals were commonly used in products like aerosol sprays and refrigerants. Over time, it was discovered that when CFCs are released into the atmosphere, they break down and release chlorine atoms. These chlorine atoms then interact with ozone molecules in the stratosphere, causing them to break apart. This process started to significantly affect the ozone layer.</p><p>Scientists first became concerned about this issue in the 1970s. It was in 1985 when a hole in the ozone layer over Antarctica was discovered.</p><p>The manner in which the CFC destroys the ozone layer in briefly described as follows:</p><ol><li>Chlorine from a CFC like such as CFCl reacts with ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) froming chlorine monoxide (ClO) and oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>).</li><li>Two Chlorine monoxide molecules react formining chlorine peroxide (Cl<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>).</li><li>Sunlight cause Cl<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (Chlorine peroxide) to breakdown into oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) and free chlorine (2Cl) atoms. The Chlorine atoms then begin the circle once more.</li></ol><h3>Harmful Effects of Ozone Layer Depletion</h3><ol><li>Ozone layer depletion also affects the growth of plants, impacting the food chain and ecosystem stability.</li><li>It disrupts the balance in the atmosphere, leading to climate change and altering weather patterns.</li><li>Ozone layer depletion also affects the growth of plants, impacting the food chain and ecosystem stability.</li></ol><h3>Control Measures Against Depletion of The Ozone Layer</h3><ol><li>180 countries have signed the Montreal Protocol, an international agreement which aimed to phase out the production and use of CFCs and other ozone-depleting substances.</li><li>Manay nations have stoped the production of CFC.</li><li>Substitute chemicals that are environmentally-friendly are being developed and used in place of those that destroy the ozone layer.</li></ol><p>However, it will still take several decades for it to fully recover, as ozone molecules are slow to regenerate in the upper atmosphere.</p><h3>Global Warming</h3><p>Normally the composition of the air (atmosphere) is:</p><img src="img/data/air composition.jpg"><p>In modern times, Human activities, such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation, have altered the atmosphere's makeup by releasing gases like carbon dioxide. These gases trap heat, leading to global warming and climate change. This shift in the atmosphere's composition has far-reaching consequences for our planet.</p><p>Global warming is the increase in the Earth's average temperature overtime. This happens because of the <u>greenhouse effect</u>.</p><h4>The Green House Effect</h4><p>A greenhouse is a special building where plants grow. It has transparent walls and a roof that lets sunlight in. This sunlight warms the inside of the greenhouse, creating a cosy environment for plants to thrive. Greenhouses are found in many countries, like the United Kingdom, where they're used to grow fruits and vegetables even in colder weather.</p><p>The greenhouse effect is a natural process that keeps the earth warm. It works like a blanket around the Earth, trapping heat from the sun in the atmosphere. This warmth is essential for life on Earth, but when we add extra greenhouse gases, like carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels, it makes this natural process stronger and our planet gets hotter, causing climate change.</p><h4>Effects of Global Warming</h4><ol><li>Earth's average temperature is increasing, leading to hotter days and warmer nights.</li><li>Polar ice caps and glaciers are melting, causing rising sea levels.</li><li>The oceans are getting warmer, affecting marine life and weather patterns.</li><li>Changing climate patterns can affect crop growth and food production.</li><li>Rising temperatures can lead to heat-related illnesses and the spread of diseases carried by insects.</li></ol><h4>Control of Global Warming</h4><ol><li>Reduce greenhouse gas emissions.</li><li>Use renewable energy sources.</li><li>Plant more trees.</li><li>Conserve energy and use energy-efficient technologies.</li><li>Limit deforestation.</li><li>Reduce, reuse, and recycle.</li><li>Support international climate agreements.</li><li>Raise awareness and education.</li></ol>

      <h2>CLASSIFICATION OF FARM ANIMALS BASED ON NUTRITION</h2><p>Based on the <u>alimentary canal</u> (digestive system), farm animals can be classified as either ruminants or non-ruminants.</p>

<ol><li><h3>Ruminants (Polygastrics)</h3><p>They are mamals that are able to acquire nutrients from plant based foods by fermenting it in a specialize stomach prior to digestion, principally through <u>microbial actions</u> (activities caried out by micro organisms).</p><p>The process which takes place at the front of the digestive system are therefore called <u>foregut fermentation</u>, which typically requires the fermented <u>ingesta</u>(cud) to be regurgitated (thrown up) and chewed again. The process of rechewing the cud to further breakdown plant matter and stimulate diggestion is called <u>rumination</u>. They are also known as <u>polygastrics</u>.</p><p>Examples of ruminant animals include:</p><ol><li>Cattles</li><li>Goats</li><li>Sheep</li><li>Giraffes</li><li>Deers</li><li>Buffaloes</li><li>Carmels</li></ol><p>Ruminant animals have 4 compartment stomach. This is what differenciates them from non-ruminant animals. The compartments are:</p><ol><li><u>Rumen</u>: <p>It is the primary site of microbial fermentation.</p></li><li><u>Reticulum</u>: <p>It is the first in the alimentary canal (digestive system) of ruminant animals. Colloquially (unofficially), it is refered to as <u>honey comb</u>.</p></li><li><u>Omasum</u>: <p>Its receives chewd cud and absorbs volatile fatty acid.</p></li><li><u>Abomasum</u>: <p>This is the true stomach.</p></li></ol></li>

<li><h3>Non-ruminants (Monogastrics)</h3><p>These are farm animals that possess a simple compartment stomach which they use for digesting their food. They are also known as <u>monogastrics</u>.</p><p>Examples of non-ruminant animals include:</p><ol><li>Poultry</li><li>Pigs</li><li>Rabbits</li><li>Horses</li><li>Donkeys</li><li>Snails</li><li>Bees</li><li>Grasscutters</li></ol></li></ol>

    <p>4. <u>Duodenum</u>:</p><p>It is the first part of the intestine and has a "U" shape.As soon as food enters into the duodenum, a hormone called <u>entero gatrone</u> helps in stoping the action of gastrine in the duodedum. The duodenum receives juice from the liver and pancreas. The liver secrets <u>bile</u> which helps in <u>emulsifying fats</u> (converting fats into globules). The pancreas also secrets its <u>pancretic juice</u> consisting of:</p><ol><li><u>Pancreatic Amylase</u>: Which converts starch into maltose.</li><li><u>Lipase</u>: Which converts fat globules into fatty acid and glycerol.</li><li><u>Trypsin</u>: Which converts peptones into polypeptides.</li></ol>
    
    <p>5. <u>Ileum</u>:</p><p>This is the longest part of the small intestine secreting <u>intestinal juice</u> which contains 4 enzymes necessary for completing food digestion:</p><ol><li><u>Maltase</u>: Which converts maltose into glucose.</li><li><u>Sucrase</u>: Which converts sucrose into glucose.</li><li><u>Lactase</u>: Which converts lactose into glucose and galactose.</li><li><u>Peptidase</u>: Which converts polypeptides into amino acids.</li></ol>

    <p>6. <u>Colon</u>:</p><p>The undigested food are carried down into the colon (large intestines). Dead cells, dead bacteria, surplus bile and other secretions are passed into the large intestines. The undigested food is passed into out as feaces through the anus. The feaces are very important for manure preparation and crop cultivation. The colon is also concerned with the reabsorption of water into the body of the animal.</p><p><u>Note</u>: The movement of food in the alimentary canal is called <u>peristalsis</u>.</p>

</ol>

<h3>Absorption of Food:</h3><p>After digestion of food, absoption and assimilation follows. Absorption of digested food takes place in the villi of the ileum. The villi are tiny fingerlike projections on the surface of the ileum.</p><img src="img/data/villus.webp"><div>Structure of the Villus</div><p>The absorption of food goes in a definite sequence. Fats and oil are absorbed at the <u>lacteal</u>, Sugar is absorbed at the <u>venule end</u>.</p><p>After absorption, excess sugar is coverted into glygogen at the liver and remains for about few hours before being converted into fats, while, proteins are converted into urhea.</p><p>After absorption, the food is now assimilated into the body of the animal.</p>

<h4>Digestion in Birds (Avian Digestion):</h4><p>Birds are also monogatric animals with simple stomachs. Digestion is slightly different from that observed in rabbits and pigs. The alimentary canal of birds consists of the mouth, oesophagus, crop, proventiculus, gizard, duoodenum, ileum, colon, caecum, anus and other parts.</p><ol><li><u>Mouth</u>: <p>There is no teeth in the mouth, it has a beak which it uses to pick up grains one after the other. The tongue aids for swallowing the food into the oesophagus.</p></li><li><u>Crop</u>: <p>This is a sac-like structure used for temporary storage of food. Certain bacteria present here helps in fermenting and moisting the food. The fermented food then leaves here and moves through the oesophagus to the proventiculus.</p></li><li><u>Proventiculus</u>: <p>This is the first part of the stomach. Here gastric juice which is acidic due to presence of dilute Hydrochloric acid (HCl) contains an enzyme called pepsin, which acts on protein and coverts it into peptones. The food then moves into the gizard.</p></li><li><u>Gizard</u>: <p>It acts as the teeth of birds and helps in the mastication and breaking up of food substances. It is a tough, thick and muscular organ which contaons pebbles or stones which helps in the grinding of the food. Bile juice from the liver is mixed up with the food substances. From here the food enters the duodenum, ileum and later the colon (The activities that happen in the duodedum, ileum and colon is involve a contineous break-down process and the absorption of nutrients into the bloodstream).</p></li><li><u>Ceacum</u>: <p>This region habours microorganisms which aid in the breaking down of cellulose into glucose.</p></li><li><u>Cloaca</u>: <p>This is the common part for reproduction and egestion of waste product. Birds don't urinate, therefore, their feaces is passed out through the vent together with their urine.</p></li></ol>

<h3>Digestion in Ruminants (Polygastric Digestion):</h3><p>Ruminants have the ability to digest cellulose and their stomach is divided into 4 chambers. Which area:</p><ol><li>Rumen</li><li>Omasum</li><li>Abomasum</li><li>Reticulum</li></ol><p>All ruminants are herbivores, but not all herbivores are ruminants. The alimentary canal of ruminants consists of the mouth, oesophagus, rumen, reticulum, omasum, abomasum, small intestine, caecum, anus and other parts.</p><ol><li><u>Mouth</u>: <p>The mouth consists of the teeth, tongue, salivary gland. the ruminant gathers grass with its tongue, holds it tightly with the teeth and jaws and pulls before swallowing. Digestive enzymes in the mouth have no time to act at this stage.</p></li><li><u>Oesophagus</u>: <p>The food passes from the mouth into the rumen through the oesophagus.</p></li><li><u>Rumen</u>: <p>This is the first stomach where certain cellulose bacteria act on the grass and convert them into starch. The rumen is also used for temporal storage of food if the ruminant is allowed to feed for a long time. The rumen extends down to the reticulum.</p></li><li><u>Reticulum</u>: <p>The food stays here for a very short time, this is the second stomach, from where the food then moves down by a process of regurgitation by anti-peristalistic movement to the mouth through tthe oesophagus. At this stage, the ruminant is said to be chewing its cud. The food is then chewed into a semi-liquid which is now swallowed in bits and moves into the omasum.</p></li><li><u>Omasum</u>: <p>It is the third stomach where food stays for sometime before it moves into the fourth stomach called the abomasum. It is also known as <u>the bible</u>, <u>fardel</u>, <u>Manypiles</u> or <u>psalterium</u>.</p></li><li><u>Abomasum</u>: <p>It is the fourth stomach and the only true stomach. Its functions are similar to what is obtained in the stomach of monogastrics. Gastric juice is secreted, which contains pepsin and renin. Pepsin acts on protein and converts it into peptones while, renin curdles milk protein by converting casein into caseinogen. The solid paste now leaves into the duodenum as <u>chyme</u>.</p></li><li><u>Small Intestine</u>: <p>Digestion is completed in the small intestine where the food is absorbed into the blood stream. Then the undigested and excess food moves into the colon where excess water is reabsorbed back into the system of the animal.</p></li><li><u>Ceacum</u>: <p>This area houses some symbiotic bacteria called <u>cellulase</u>, which helps in the digestion of cellulose. Part of the digestion cellulose is utilized by the bacteria and the other reabsorbed into the blood stream of the ruminant.</p></li><li><u>Anus</u>: <p>The undigested food is now passed out as <u>dungs</u> through the anus of the animal.</p></li></ol><img src="img/data/ruminant digestion.webp"><div>Process of Digestion in Ruminants</div>
