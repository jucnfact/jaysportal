      note: [`<h3>Dominant and Recessive Traits</h3><p>You noticed that in Gregor Mendel's experiment reported above, he observed  that the traits (characteristics) of tallness overshadowed that of shortness, when the parental tall plants were crossed with parental short plants.</p><p>When one characteristic overshadows (shows more than) another in the offspring, it is said to be <u>dominant</u> over the other characteristics, while the one which is suppressed (not noticed) is said to be <u>recessive</u>.</p><img src="img/data/pea.webp"><p>Diagram of a garden pea</p><h4>Dominant and Recessive Traits in the Garden Pea</h4><p>The table below shows dominant and recessive traits in the garden pea as observed by Mendel.</p><img src="img/data/Dominant and Recessive Traits.png"><p>Gregor mendel wisely used pea plants for his experiments and made his observations within a short period. His results were so good and convincing that today he is regarded as the father of the science of genetics. Today, scientists use plants, rats, rabbits, chickens,  and so on for genetic experiments.</p><p>To do genetic experiments with human beings is very difficult for serveral reasons.</p><ol><li>Experimental crossing of human beings is unethical.</li><li><u>The life of a human being is long:</u> If for example, you want to know what the hair colour of children would be when a black haired man marries a light haired woman, you would have to wait for twenty or more years after marriage to get one set of results. You need to repaet this experiment several times to be confident of your result. You might not live to get confirmatory results.</li><li>If the pea plant had seven pairs of contrasting characteristics, a human would have many more than that number.</li><li>In human beings, many characteristics do not have a simple pattern, such as tall or short characteristics in peas. Many human characteristics show continuous variations from one form to another. For instance,<ol><li>Intelligence varies continuously from half-wit to genius;</li><li>Skin colour varies continuously from black to light colour;</li><li>Height varies continuously from dwarf to gaint.</li></ol></li></ol><p>Nevertheless, inheritance of traits in human beings is studied mainly through observation.</p><p>In spite of drawbacks (limitations or disadvantages), it is now possible, with a resonable measure of confidence, to identify some dominant and some recessive traits in human beings.</p><h3>Importance of Family Traits</h3><p>Knowledge of family traits has been useful in</p><ol><li>Tracing family members</li><li>Reducing the occurence of hereditary diseases like Sickle-cell Anaemia.</li><li>Crime detection</li></ol>`]}
